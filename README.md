# Part 1 of the Project
## Objective
Study how we should act on a robot so that it transfers from a given position to another desired position, in three separate variations of this problem:
  - `Section A` How should we act on the robot - Using simple control signals - so that the robot also passes, as close as possible to certain intermediate `points`?
  - `Section B` How should we act on the robot - Using simple control signals - so that the robot also passes, as close as possible, to certain intermediate `regions`?
  - `Section C` How should we act on the robot so that it also passes exactly on as many intermideate points as possible?
  
## `Section A` Approximate intermidiate points and simple control signals
## `Section B` Approximate intermidiate regions and simple control signals
## `Section C` Exact intermidiate points
